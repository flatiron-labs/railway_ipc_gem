## [Unreleased]
### Added
### Changed
### Removed
### Fixed
* Fix RPC server. RPC servers need to conform to the Sneaker worker API (i.e. their initializers need to be able to accept queue name / pool and they require a `stop` method.

## [2.0.2] - 2020-08-27
### Changed
* RPC `RailwayIpc::Client` does not need to log the queue name.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-08-24
### Fixed
* `RailwayIpc::Logger` now handles block syntax (i.e. `logger.info { 'my message' }`) correctly.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-08-20
### Added
* Several additions to internal logging:
  - Log messages now include a `feature` key. This can be used by logging aggregator tools to group log messages across different systems that use the gem. If one isn't provided a default value of `railway_ipc` is used.
  - Protobufs are logged as a sub-hash which contains both the protobuf type and payload.
  - Exchange and queue names are logged where applicable.
  - The internal Bunny connection now uses the `RailwayIpc::Logger` instead of a generic `Logger`.

### Changed
* *Breaking Change* `RailwayIpc.configure` now takes `device`, `level`, and `formatter` instead of a complete `Logger` instance. The instance is now managed internally by Railway. This is a breaking change to the `RailwayIpc.configure` API, clients will need to be updated to use the new syntax.

## [1.1.0] - 2020-08-07
### Changed
* allow multiple consumers to handle the same message
* consumed messages table requires its own primary key due to ActiveRecord not having support for composite primary keys

## [1.0.1] - 2020-07-23
### Fixed
* Fix publisher connection by using default connection if one isn't provided

## [1.0.0] - 2020-07-20
### Added
* CircleCI build that runs the specs
* Rubocop (also ran by CircleCI)
* New error types for incoming messages
* RailwayIpc::Messages::Unknown protobuf

### Changed
* Refactored worker to use ProcessIncomingMessage and IncomingMessage abstractions
* Moved decoding logic from ConsumedMessage to IncomingMessage
* Removed STATUSES constant from ConsumedMessage
* Publisher is no longer a Singleton; kept a Singleton version of the Publisher for backwards compatibility that gives a "deprecated" warning

### Removed
* Removed `BaseMessage` protobuf
* NullMessage and NullHandler were removed

### Fixed
* Fixed all Rubocop warnings and errors

## [0.1.7] - 2020-06-29
